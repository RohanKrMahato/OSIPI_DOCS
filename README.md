# How to Run This Project

To set up and run this project, follow these steps:

**Serve the Documentation**:
    ```sh
    # we need to install the multirepo plugin
    # we need to install gallery and mkdocs string plugin
    
    pip install mkdocs
    mkdocs serve
    ```

This will start a local server where you can view the documentation.
